# Replication Project for MA 
This project is a replication of the article titled "National Policy and Transnational Governance of Climate Change: Substitutes or Compliments?". 

The replication was done in R using the authors' stata codebook. Changes were made to certain variables as the diagnostics indicated a serious problem with transformations and distributions.
